# 🧠 SynapseOS

### 🚀 Intent

This project aims to become a powerful, open-source engine that understands your codebase deeply and serves intelligent explanations to agents, and developers.

Instead of just parsing files, this engine will:

* Provide **multi-level explanations** (from basic summaries to full causal understanding)
* Track when and how a function is used, including:

  * Where it's called in the call stack
  * What lifecycle phase it runs in (e.g., before benchmarks)
  * What side effects, failures, or downstream impacts it causes
* Let clients (like AI agents) request exactly the level of context they need
* Update its internal understanding based on file changes — either automatically or when told to

In short:

> This is a **fast, configurable, research-grade engine** that any LLM-powered dev tool can build on top of.

### 🤝 For Contributors

We’re building a general-purpose, high-performance core for agentic tooling — and we need help from anybody with somethin.

**Areas of focus:**

* 🧠 Code parsing and semantic graph construction (Tree-sitter, etc.)
* 🏗️ Workspace modeling, file watching, and change tracking
* 🔍 Query APIs and explanation-level interfaces
* 🧬 Embedding + vector search integration
* 🛠️ Open, composable architecture that other tools can extend

If you're interested in building foundational tools for the future of AI-driven development, feel free to open an issue, pitch a direction, or just watch the project — we're happy to have early collaborators.
